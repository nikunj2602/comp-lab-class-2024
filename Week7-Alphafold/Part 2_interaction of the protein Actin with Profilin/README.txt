Nucleotide Binding Sites

Nucleotides were found to bind at both the N-terminus and C-terminus of the protein structure in the predictions.
Analysis revealed significant differences between the Alphafold 2 (AF2) and Alphafold 3 (AF3) models in the nucleotide binding regions, especially at the terminal residues.
These variations suggest that the two models predict nucleotide interactions differently, highlighting some uncertainty regarding the binding modes.

Disordered Region

A notable difference in distance around residue 50 corresponds to a disordered region, as confirmed by VMD using B-factor or plDDT score color coding.
In VMD, this disordered area appeared red, indicating high prediction uncertainty.
Disordered regions often exhibit greater structural variability across models due to their inherent flexibility or poorly defined secondary structures, leading to larger discrepancies.

Functional Implications

The differences in nucleotide binding sites imply variations in how AF2 and AF3 predict binding modes, which could influence the protein's biochemical activity, particularly in areas crucial for nucleotide interaction.
The disordered region near residue 50 reflects significant prediction uncertainty, typical for flexible loops or less defined structures. This variability could potentially impact the protein's stability or function.
